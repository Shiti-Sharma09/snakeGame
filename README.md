### Snake Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game that has entertained people for decades. In this game, the player controls a snake, guiding it to consume food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as possible without crashing.

## Languages and Technologies Used:

- HTML: The HyperText Markup Language is used to structure the content of the game. HTML elements form the skeleton of the game, providing a canvas for the snake and its environment.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets add style to the game. They are used to define the visual aspects such as colors, positioning, and layout of the game elements, making the game visually appealing.

- JavaScript: This versatile programming language is the backbone of the Snake Game. JavaScript brings the game to life by handling the logic, animations, and interactions. It is responsible for moving the snake, detecting collisions, and updating the score.
